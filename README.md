The big button what records the trucks!

## Simple Usage Instructions
Change pinBTN to whatever pin you want to use as the button press. I've found that 5 appears to reset the board rather than do anything when shorted, and I'm using 1 as the LED output, so maybe don't use those ones.

Connect that pin to the button and the other side to GND.

Run code.

You can optionally hook an LED across pin 1 and GND and it will illuminate at the same time as the board LED, which is fun and cool.

## Further development
I mean, lots.
